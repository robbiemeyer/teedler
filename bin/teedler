  The largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys
  coriacea), which reaches a shell length of 200 cm (66 ft) and can reach a
  weight of over 900 kg (2,000 lb). Freshwater turtles are generally smaller, but
  with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle Pelochelys cantorii, a few
  individuals have been reported up to 200 cm (66 ft). This dwarfs even the
  better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America,
  which attains a shell length of up to 80 cm (26 ft) and weighs as much as
  1134 kg (250 lb).[17] Giant tortoises of the genera Geochelone, Meiolania, and
  others were relatively widely distributed around the world into prehistoric
  times, and are known to have existed in North and South America, Australia, and
  Africa. They became extinct at the same time as the appearance of man, and it
  is assumed humans hunted them for food. The only surviving giant tortoises are
  on the Seychelles and GalÃ¡pagos Islands and can grow to over 130 cm (51 in) in
  length, and weigh about 300 kg (660 lb).
